Hello welcome to MacPacS Tools!

i make a simple python script that saves data from a website or scarp websites.

This mean that i can take: "Html files,Css files,PHP Files,JS Files!"

-----------Download-----------

So how to install it? yea its pretty easy tho :)

Open Powershell or CMD and type the following command: "pip install requests beautifulsoup4"

This will install a libary!

then open the python script and change whatever you want!

Then save the py and put a url in, if a error happen its meaning that it cant scrap any files

This error is going to V 5.12 or V 7.19 (Not Releases yet.)

Now enyoy and scrap your websites!

DO NOT STEAL CODE OR SEVRERS FROM A SITE PLS DO THIS TO TEST AND HOW TO LEARN CODE!!!
