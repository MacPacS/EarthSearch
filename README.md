Hello welcome to MacPacS Tools!

i make a simple python script that saves data from a website or scarp websites.

This mean that i can take: "Html files,Css files,PHP Files,JS Files!"

----------info------------
If u download the Releases then unzip the file and the pass is: 2024

Also in the Releases you can get other versions without any credit that made by me,

thats only use for testing and learning code!


-----------Download-----------

So how to install it? yea its pretty easy tho :)

Open Powershell or CMD and type the following command: "pip install requests beautifulsoup4"

This will install a libary!

then open the python script and change whatever you want!

Then save the py and put a url in, if a error happen its meaning that it cant scrap any files

This error is going to V 5.12 or V 7.19 (Not Releases yet.)

Now enyoy and scrap your websites!

BTW IF YOU PUT THE URL IN AND ENTER IF GONNA SAVE SOME FILES AND IF U OPEN YOUR DOWNLOADS (WHEN ITS DONE) A NEW FOLDER IS CREATED AND IT HAS WEIRD LETTER AND NUMBERS. OPEN THAT AND DONE

DO NOT STEAL CODE OR SEVRERS FROM A SITE PLS DO THIS TO TEST AND HOW TO LEARN CODE!!!
